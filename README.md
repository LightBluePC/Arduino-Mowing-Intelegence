## Arduino-Mowing-Intelegence
Arduino controlling motors and using software effectively to do simple routing for lawn mowing purposes. This project will try to use wifi as the connection to the Arduino and use a server for more computing power if need be.
##YANGNIY = you are not gonna need it yet!
##DRY = Don't repeat yourself!
The Plan (Time is based on one person working while juggling a full time job)
-1. Do reashearch and plan before doing random work.
0. setup github repository to hold the software, plans, and documents of this porject. Everthing should be stored and have read.me here
1. setting up the connection arduino to computer (ETA => 1.5 months)
    - build connect arduino to wifi (1 week)
    - build connection arduino to PC (1 week)
    - build simple controller on the PC (2 weeks)
    - build intructions/scripts to set this up (1 week) (youtube video?)
2. Build version one of the machine! 
    - built a early prototype using wheel chair motors and plywood (done)
    - used Dimession Engineering Sabertooth curcuit for controlling the motors (done)
    - used the transformer from outlet to apprpriate voltage for motors
    - all logic controlers on 5 volts low amp electrical system
    - all motors on 12 volts 30 amps electrical system
    - using arduino with wifi cc3000 sheild (already out of date) (done, will need to change later)
3. setting up connection from arduino to Dimession Enginnering circuit. ie make the computer controller.
    - still need to setup connection from ardiono to PC
    - still need to setup connection from arduino to Dimenssion Enginnering curcuit (currently set up for radio control)
    - test the controls work in real life
    - set up camera feed? (thinking of using ip cameras, or arduino wifi 
    - (future, YANGNIY!) create a phone app controller debatible on how to do this
4. finding tolleraces and testing wifi latancy (fine tuning protocals)
    example: turing left,right,forward,backward what happens when signal is lost ect...
    -look into google protobuf?
    -look into graphQI?
    -do some reashearch see what other professionals do.
5. add needed sensors debate the design of cameras or other detection methods. (TBD)
6. make the pathing algorithym and test it. (TBD)
7. refactor all code (TBD)
8. have fun (all the time)
9. cut grass this will be fun :) (TBD)
10. figure out how to properly cut grass (TBD)
11. think about a snow blower option (TBD)
12. 3D model the lawn mower design (TBD)
13. start analizing the parts for actual production (TBD)
14. advertise (TBD)
15. build garage production (TBD)
